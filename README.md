# Smart-Industrial-Automation-and-Monitoring-System
Smart industrial automation system using Arduino and ESP8266 with FreeRTOS. It adjusts lighting based on sunlight, user input, and motion detection. Monitors gas leakage and temperature, controls cooling via relay, and publishes sensor data to an MQTT-based IoT dashboard for real-time monitoring.

Tech Stack: NodeMCU ESP8266, MQTTT mosquito broker, Arduino uno -R3, MQ-135 , Arduino IDE, BTA41-600B.

Features:
Gas leak detection & auto-alert 
Temperature-based fan control
Remote appliance control (lights, pump) automatically according to User and Environment Factors
User interface via MQTT IOT Panel App
